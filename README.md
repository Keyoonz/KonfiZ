## Installation

Installation has not been tested from a fresh install yet proceed at your own risk.
It is what I remember doing and what I would do from a fresh install.

This installation guide assume you have a minimal installation of Arch Linux. It also assume you have setup your graphics drivers correctly (especially for nivida gpu).

Make sure to install all the dependencies listed [above](#requirements).

Clone this repo and go into it (the folder containing the repo must be in your home folder here : `~/konfiz`) :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keyoonz/konfiz ~/konfiz && cd ~/konfiz
```

Setup all the dotfiles

```bash
stow .
```

It is now time to setup sddm, use these commands to make it ready for use.

```bash
sudo ln -s ~/konfiz/.config/sddm.conf.d/ /etc
sudo cp -r ~/konfiz/.config/sddm-custom-theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```

Now start the required sockets

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm
systemctl --user enable pipewire
```

If you don't have an nvidia gpu, comment the relevant lines in `.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

Everything should be good to go after a reboot.
Remember that this installation guide has not been tested yet, you might need to debug some stuff.

## Usage

All keybindings are specified in `.config/hypr/keybinds.conf`

## What's next ?

This configuration is for now using catppuccin's color palette and cursors.
I plan on making my own cursor.

I also want to generate a color palette based on your wallpaper.

Grub, firefox, wallpaper and more things are still on my Todo list.
